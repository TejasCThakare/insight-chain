## 🚀 Updates

- **[Oct 2025]** Demo deployment complete with public Gradio interface  
- **[Oct 2025]** Training and inference code now available  
- **[Oct 2025]** Project repository is live!

## 🔍 Overview

Given an image and question, Insight-Chain generates both detailed reasoning steps and a concise summary. The system uses two specialized LoRA adapters fine-tuned on Qwen2-VL-2B: one for generating multi-step visual analysis, and another for producing condensed answers. Both adapters are loaded sequentially to minimize memory usage (~10GB peak).

**Key Features:**
- Explainable AI with transparent reasoning  
- Memory-efficient sequential loading (37% reduction vs standard)  
- Complete end-to-end pipeline from training to deployment  
- Zero-cost training on Google Colab

## 🧪 Inference

### Launch Demo
```bash
python demo/app.py
```
Access at `http://localhost:7860`

### Command Line Inference
```bash
python scripts/run_inference.py \
--model "models/reasoning_agent/final" \
--image "path/to/image.jpg" \
--question "What do you see?"
```

### Python API
```python
from insight_chain import DualAgentVQA

model = DualAgentVQA(
    reasoning_adapter="models/reasoning_agent/final",
    summary_adapter="models/summary_agent/final"
)

result = model.predict(
    image="path/to/image.jpg",
    question="What do you see?"
)

print(result['reasoning'])
print(result['summary'])
```
